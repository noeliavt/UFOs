From this information we can observe the following results:

* Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.
* The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkable similar.
* The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.

## 3. Summary

The weather in December and June are very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's, then we can conclude since there is a little fluctuation in the temperature the ice cream shop bussiness will sustainable year-around.
